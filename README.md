## Project Name
# **AI KYC AGENT**
  
KYC Agent: Automate Routine work of KYC process

ðŸ”Ž **AI KYC AGENT**: An innovative AI-powered KYC agent that streamlines KYC processes, reduces costs, and enhances compliance. The financial industry is increasingly reliant on Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to mitigate risk and comply with regulations. This provides an alernative to traditional KYC methods which are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.

# Why AI KYC AGENT?

### Why Is KYC Important?
Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are essential in the financial industry to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. Regulatory compliance ensures that businesses operate within legal frameworks, protecting both institutions and customers from financial crimes.

### The Problem with Manual KYC
Traditional KYC methods rely heavily on manual reviews, which come with several challenges:
- Time-Consuming â€“ Verifications often take days, delaying customer onboarding.
- High Costs â€“ Labor-intensive processes lead to increased operational expenses.
- Error-Prone â€“ Human oversight can result in inconsistencies, leading to compliance risks.
- Scalability Issues â€“ As customer bases grow, manual processes struggle to keep up.

### How This Solves These Challenges
Our AI-powered KYC agent offers a smarter alternative by:
- âœ… Reducing Costs â€“ Eliminating the need for extensive manual labor.
- âœ… Enhancing Compliance â€“ Ensuring accuracy and adherence to regulatory requirements.
- âœ… Scaling Efficiently â€“ Handling large volumes of customers without sacrificing quality.
- âœ… Automating Documentation Processing â€“ Faster processing with real-time processing.

By leveraging advanced AI, this solution transforms KYC into a streamlined, cost-effective, and highly compliant processâ€”empowering businesses to operate more efficiently in an increasingly regulated landscape.

# Getting started 
AI KYC AGENT has two flows which act as a comprehensive KYC Agent. The first flow is a KYC procedure Agent, to analyse Policy Documents via the KYC Procedure agent. The second flow to analyse Client Documentation via the KYC Ops Agent. 

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system. 

First, install .... :

```shell
pip install ...
```

### 2. Setting Up with the YAML Configuration

To create a new project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:

```shell
... 
```

This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ my_project/
        â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ 
        â”œâ”€â”€ 
        â””â”€â”€ config/
            â”œâ”€â”€ agents.yaml
            â””â”€â”€ tasks.yaml
```


### 3. Running Your AI KYC AGENT

Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:

- ...
- ...

Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:

```shell
cd ...
...
```
