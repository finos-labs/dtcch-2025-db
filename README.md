# **KYC Agent: Automate Routine work of KYC process**

ðŸ”Ž **AI KYC AGENT**: An innovative AI-powered KYC agent that streamlines KYC processes, reduces costs, and enhances compliance. The financial industry is increasingly reliant on Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to mitigate risk and comply with regulations. This provides an alernative to traditional KYC methods which are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.

# Why AI KYC Agent?

### Why Is KYC Important?
Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are essential in the financial industry to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. Regulatory compliance ensures that businesses operate within legal frameworks, protecting both institutions and customers from financial crimes.

### The Problem with Manual KYC
Traditional KYC methods rely heavily on manual reviews, which come with several challenges:
- Time-Consuming â€“ Verifications often take days, delaying customer onboarding.
- High Costs â€“ Labor-intensive processes lead to increased operational expenses.
- Error-Prone â€“ Human oversight can result in inconsistencies, leading to compliance risks.
- Scalability Issues â€“ As customer bases grow, manual processes struggle to keep up.

### How This Solves These Challenges
Our AI-powered KYC agent offers a smarter alternative by:
- âœ… Reducing Costs â€“ Eliminating the need for extensive manual labor.
- âœ… Enhancing Compliance â€“ Ensuring accuracy and adherence to regulatory requirements.
- âœ… Scaling Efficiently â€“ Handling large volumes of customers without sacrificing quality.
- âœ… Automating Documentation Processing â€“ Faster processing with real-time processing.

By leveraging advanced AI, this solution transforms KYC into a streamlined, cost-effective, and highly compliant processâ€”empowering businesses to operate more efficiently in an increasingly regulated landscape.

# Getting started 
AI KYC AGENT has two flows which act as a comprehensive KYC Agent. The first flow is a KYC procedure Agent, to analyse Policy Documents via the KYC Procedure agent. The second flow to analyse Client Documentation via the KYC Ops Agent. 

### 1. Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system, as well as a Postgress instance. 

To install the required for frontend dependencies, naviagte to the directory and install requirements:

```shell
cd kyc-ui-dashboard
```

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install the required for backend dependencies, naviiagte to the directory and install requirements:
```shell
cd ..
cd llm_agent_workflows
```

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Pytesseract, follow the steps listed in [Pytesseract README](./README_pytesseract.md).

Create the tables to store all your objects by running the folloing script [Database Schemas](./database/ddl.sql).

For the email web backend run the folloing script [Database Schemas](./web-backend/schema.sql).

### 2. Setting your environmet 

Ensure you're in the maion directory and copy and fill in your own corresponding environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Fill in the config.py from the web backend. 
```bash
cd web-backend
config.py 
```


### 3. Running Your AI KYC AGENT

1. Run the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd kyc-ui-dashboard
    npm run start
    ```

2. Run the email service 

    ```bash
    cd web-backend
    python run.py
    ```

## Overview diagram

## Autonomy diagram
This diagram illustrates the current level of autonomy in the KYC landscape. As shown below, autonomy is categorized into five levels. It is important to note that most existing KYC tools fall under Level 1 or 2, where KYC Operations drive the process, potentially with AI answering KYC-related questions. This solution aims to achieve Level 4, where an AI Agent can manage the entire process, with KYC Operations providing supervision.
