JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,1,Financial Regulation; Money Laundering Prevention; Counter-Terrorism Financing; UK Financial Compliance; Financial Security Guidelines,"This is the cover page of an official guidance document published by the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) for the UK financial sector. The document, originally released in 2020 and amended in July 2022, focuses on two main areas: the prevention of money laundering and combating terrorist financing. This appears to be Part I of the guidance, indicating it's part of a larger series. The document is copyrighted by JMLSG, with all rights reserved, and any reproduction or transmission requires explicit consent from the organization. The document was drafted and edited by Carol J. Smit. The formal nature and source of this document suggests it serves as an authoritative reference for financial institutions in the UK regarding their anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) obligations."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,2,Financial Compliance; Anti-Money Laundering; Risk Management; Corporate Governance; Regulatory Framework,"This appears to be a detailed table of contents for a comprehensive financial compliance manual or guidebook, focusing primarily on anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) regulations. The document is structured into four main chapters: Senior Management Responsibility, Internal Controls, Nominated Officer/MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer), and Risk-based Approach. Each chapter contains detailed subsections addressing specific aspects of financial crime prevention and regulatory compliance. The content covers international standards, UK legal frameworks, organizational obligations, risk assessments, and implementation of controls. Key topics include senior management obligations, group policies, territorial considerations, internal control requirements, MLRO responsibilities, and risk-based approaches to compliance.

The detailed section numbering (e.g., 1.1-1.8, 2.1-2.2, etc.) suggests this is a formal regulatory or guidance document with precise reference points for each topic covered."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,3,Risk Assessment; Customer Due Diligence (CDD); Identity Verification; Compliance Procedures; Financial Security,"This content appears to be from a financial compliance manual or guidebook that details various aspects of customer due diligence (CDD) and risk management procedures. The document is structured in sections covering different aspects of risk assessment and customer verification processes. It begins with guidance on risk weighting, discussing both lower and higher risk scenarios requiring simplified or enhanced due diligence respectively. The text emphasizes the importance of a dynamic risk-based approach, including proper monitoring and record-keeping of control measures. A significant portion focuses on CDD measures, including the definition, timing, and implementation of customer verification procedures. The document provides detailed guidance on handling different types of customers, from private individuals to regulated financial firms, and special cases such as executors, attorneys, and financially excluded individuals. It also addresses specific situations like electronic verification, dealing with shell banks, and handling customers who cannot provide standard documentation. The content includes special considerations for various vulnerable groups, including those in care homes, students, and those without standard identification documents. Throughout, there is emphasis on maintaining proper records and keeping customer information up to date, while also ensuring compliance with financial sanctions and regulations against money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,4,Customer Due Diligence; Corporate Compliance; Financial Regulations; Entity Types; Risk Management,"This content appears to be a detailed table of contents or index from a regulatory compliance document focused on customer due diligence requirements for different types of entities and business relationships. It covers a wide range of entity types including corporate customers, public companies, private companies, partnerships, public sector bodies, sovereign wealth funds, pension schemes, charities, trusts, and clubs/societies. For each entity type, it outlines sections on obtaining standard evidence, beneficial ownership considerations, and specific requirements. The document also includes sections on simplified and enhanced due diligence procedures, with special attention to politically exposed persons (PEPs). The latter portions address multipartite relationships and reliance on third parties, including group introductions and the use of pro forma confirmations. Each section is referenced with specific paragraph numbers (5.3.139 through 5.6.30), suggesting this is part of a larger regulatory guidance document. The structure indicates a comprehensive framework for how different types of entities should be treated from a compliance and due diligence perspective."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,5,Compliance Documentation; Financial Regulations; Customer Monitoring; Staff Training; Record Keeping,"This content appears to be from a financial compliance manual or regulatory guidebook, covering several key areas of financial compliance and anti-money laundering procedures. The document is organized into multiple chapters (5-8) addressing various aspects of compliance requirements. Key topics include:

Chapter 5 covers situations involving intermediaries and customer monitoring, including scenarios where firms act as introducers and the roles of intermediaries as agents for either providers or customers.

Chapter 6 focuses on suspicious activity reporting and data protection, detailing obligations regarding knowledge and suspicion, internal and external reporting procedures, consent requirements under POCA and Terrorism Act, and tipping off regulations.

Chapter 7 addresses staff awareness and training requirements, outlining the responsibilities of both the firm and its employees, training methods, and the importance of staff alertness to specific situations.

Chapter 8 deals with record keeping obligations, specifying what records must be maintained (customer information, transactions, reports), how they should be kept, and where they should be stored. Each chapter includes specific section numbers (e.g., 5.6.31-5.6.32) for easy reference and includes various annexes with pro-forma confirmations and risk factor guidelines. The document appears to be a comprehensive guide for financial institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,6,Financial Regulations; Anti-Money Laundering; Counter-Terrorism; UK Legislation; Financial Compliance,"This page appears to be a table of contents or reference section outlining key UK legislation and regulatory frameworks related to financial crime and compliance. It includes three main sections: a glossary of terms, anti-money laundering responsibilities in the UK (Appendix I), and a summary of UK legislation (Appendix II). The legislation summary covers several important acts and regulations: the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (with amendments), terrorism-related acts (Terrorism Act 2000 and Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001), the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (Schedule 7), financial sanctions, the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 (with amendments), and FCA Handbook requirements for regulated firms. This structure suggests the document is likely a comprehensive guide or reference manual for financial compliance and anti-money laundering requirements in the UK."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,7,Financial Regulation; Money Laundering; Legal Framework; Compliance Guidelines; Financial Crime Prevention,"This preface outlines the UK's regulatory framework and guidance for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. It begins by describing the historical context of UK money laundering regulations, starting from 1993 through to the 2017 regulations, including key legislation like the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000. The document explains its purpose as providing guidance for financial institutions on implementing AML/CTF requirements through a risk-based approach. The guidance aims to help firms interpret legal requirements, establish best practices, and design appropriate control systems. The scope allows firms some flexibility in applying requirements based on their specific circumstances while meeting regulatory obligations. The text also defines money laundering, listing various forms including converting criminal proceeds into legitimate funds, handling stolen goods or proceeds from crimes like theft and fraud, facilitating criminal or terrorist property transactions, and criminals investing illegal proceeds in financial products. Importantly, it notes that customer identification requirements don't automatically guarantee access to financial services, as firms maintain separate commercial considerations for customer acceptance."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,8,Money Laundering Offenses; Terrorist Financing; Financial Crime Compliance; Regulatory Requirements; Risk Management,"This content outlines key aspects of money laundering and terrorist financing regulations and their relationship to other financial crimes. It explains that money laundering techniques constantly evolve to adapt to different regulatory environments and funding sources. The text identifies three main categories of money laundering offenses: knowingly assisting in concealing criminal property, failing to report suspicious activity, and tipping off investigations. It also notes that failing to establish adequate anti-money laundering policies is a separate offense under ML Regulations.

Regarding terrorist financing, the content highlights its similarities to money laundering but emphasizes two key differences: terrorist acts often require small amounts of money (making them harder to track), and terrorist funds can originate from legitimate sources. Despite this, terrorist organizations may need significant funding for their infrastructure and use sophisticated methods to manage and move funds across jurisdictions.

The text emphasizes firms' obligations to report suspicious activities related to terrorist financing, enabling law enforcement to freeze or seize suspected terrorist property. It also discusses the interconnection between money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes like fraud and market abuse. While these latter crimes are not directly covered by this guidance, their proceeds fall within its scope. The content concludes by recommending that firms integrate their approaches to different financial crimes, ensuring strong communication between departments responsible for managing various risk areas."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,9,Financial Compliance; AML/CTF Guidance; Risk Management; Regulatory Framework; Corporate Responsibility,"This content outlines the scope, audience, and application of JMLSG (Joint Money Laundering Steering Group) guidance for financial institutions. The guidance is primarily targeted at firms that are members of JMLSG trade associations and FCA-regulated entities, though other financial services firms may adopt it as industry best practice. The document is particularly relevant for senior management, nominated officers, and Money Laundering Reporting Officers (MLROs). The guidance emphasizes a risk-based approach to compliance with AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing) regulations, rather than a rigid checklist methodology. It distinguishes between mandatory requirements (indicated by 'must') and recommended practices (indicated by 'should'). The content stresses senior management's responsibility in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks, including customer due diligence measures and activity monitoring. The guidance includes reference materials to help relevant parties understand the UK AML/CTF framework. Importantly, firms are encouraged to develop their own detailed internal procedures based on their specific risk profiles while using this guidance as a foundation. The document also clarifies that firms have some discretion in how they comply with AML/CTF legislation and regulation, provided they maintain appropriate and proportionate risk management systems."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,10,Financial Regulation; Money Laundering Guidance; Compliance Framework; Industry Standards; Legal Requirements,"This content details the structure and significance of the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) guidance for the UK financial sector. The guidance is organized into three parts: Part I contains generic guidance applicable across the financial sector, Part II provides sector-specific guidance, and Part III covers additional specific areas. Part I consists of eight chapters covering essential aspects including senior management responsibilities, financial crime controls, nominated officer roles, risk-based customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, staff training, and record keeping. The guidance has significant legal standing, as courts must consider it when determining compliance with the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA), Terrorism Act, and Money Laundering (ML) Regulations. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also uses adherence to this guidance when evaluating firms' compliance and considering enforcement actions. While firms can deviate from the guidance, they must document and justify such departures to regulators. The guidance serves as a comprehensive framework for firms to meet their legal and regulatory obligations when adapted to their specific risk profiles."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,11,Financial Industry Associations; UK Financial Organizations; Trade Bodies; Financial Services Membership; JMLSG Composition,"The page lists all 14 member organizations that comprise the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG). These members represent a diverse range of financial sectors including banking, insurance, credit unions, electronic money, investments, and financial markets. Key members include the Association of British Insurers (ABI), UK Finance (UKF), the Building Societies Association (BSA), and the Investment Association (IA). The membership encompasses both traditional financial institutions and newer financial technology sectors through organizations like the Electronic Money Association (EMA). The list demonstrates the broad scope of the JMLSG's representation across the UK's financial services industry, including organizations that represent foreign banks (AFB), venture capital (BVCA), and financial advisors (PIMFA)."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,12,Financial Regulations & Compliance; Anti-Money Laundering; Counter-Terrorism Financing; Corporate Governance; Management Responsibilities,"This chapter outlines the comprehensive regulatory framework and management responsibilities for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF). It details multiple layers of regulatory guidance, from international to national levels, including FATF Recommendations, UN Security Council Resolutions, EU Directives, and UK-specific legislation. The framework encompasses Basel papers, IAIS and IOSCO guidelines, and various UK laws including the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The content emphasizes senior management's core obligations, particularly in FCA-regulated firms, which include: identifying and managing business risks, appointing nominated officers and MLROs for disclosure processing, ensuring adequate resource allocation for AML/CTF activities, and understanding potential personal liability for non-compliance. Required actions include developing formal policy statements for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, maintaining adequate resources, and commissioning annual MLRO reports with timely follow-up on identified deficiencies. The regulatory framework also notes the extra-territorial application of some overseas jurisdictions' regimes, highlighting the global nature of AML/CTF compliance requirements."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,13,Money Laundering Regulations; Risk Management; Senior Management Responsibilities; Compliance Requirements; Risk Assessment,"This page outlines key requirements and responsibilities regarding money laundering and terrorist financing prevention in financial firms. The content emphasizes that firms must implement risk-based approaches to prevent being used for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. Senior management has specific responsibilities to ensure appropriate policies and controls are in place and effectively operated. The ML Regulations require firms to assess risks by considering multiple factors including customer information, geographic areas, products, services, and delivery channels, while taking into account information provided by the FCA. The assessment should incorporate findings from the National Risk Assessment and be proportionate to the firm's size and nature. While firms should assume most customers are not money launderers or terrorist financiers, they must maintain systems to identify higher-risk customers. Senior management must be actively involved in decision-making and take ownership of the risk-based approach, with specific approval required for policies and procedures. These policies must be regularly updated to reflect changing risks. For firms of appropriate size and nature, a board member or senior manager must be appointed as the officer responsible for ML Regulations compliance. The text emphasizes that inadequate approaches can lead to reputational, legal, and regulatory risks for the firm."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,14,Risk Management; AML/CTF Compliance; International Standards; Regulatory Framework; High-Risk Jurisdictions,"This content focuses on several key aspects of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) frameworks. Senior management's role in risk assessment and mitigation is emphasized, with the requirement that they must be aware of money laundering risks and ensure appropriate mitigation measures are in place. High-risk business relationships require senior management escalation. The text then outlines the international AML/CTF landscape, highlighting how governments worldwide are implementing legislation to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plays a crucial role by issuing international standards and maintaining oversight of countries with strategic deficiencies through their International Co-operation Review Group (ICRG). The European Union's implementation of FATF recommendations through directives is discussed, particularly noting the UK's adoption through the Money Laundering Regulations 2017. Post-Brexit, from January 2021, the UK established its own standalone list of high-risk countries, which mirrors FATF's jurisdictions under increased monitoring. This list is formally set out in Schedule 3ZA of the ML Regulations and is amended by The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (High-Risk Countries) Regulations 2022. The content also notes that ML/TF risk associated with individual countries can be assessed through additional sources, including HM Treasury."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,15,Financial Regulation; Anti-Money Laundering; International Compliance; Sanctions Framework; UK Legal Framework,"This content outlines key aspects of international and UK financial compliance frameworks, particularly focusing on anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Internationally, organizations like FATF, Basel, IAIS, and IOSCO promote risk-based due diligence procedures for financial firms. The UN and EU maintain sanctions lists targeting specific individuals, organizations, and nationals, with HM Treasury's Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation managing these in the UK. Organizations like Transparency International and the Wolfsberg Group provide additional guidance for AML/CTF approaches. The UK's framework is based on public-private partnership, with objectives specified in legislation and FCA Rules but allowing flexibility in implementation. Key elements of the UK framework include the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Terrorism Act 2000, Money Laundering Regulations 2017, Counter-terrorism Act 2008, HM Treasury Sanctions Notices, and the FCA Handbook. The framework emphasizes a risk-based approach while maintaining compliance with international standards and EU-derived regulations, even as they've been incorporated into UK law."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,16,Financial Crime Regulation; UK Anti-Money Laundering; Counter-Terrorism Finance; Law Enforcement Strategy; Public-Private Partnership,"This content outlines key aspects of the UK's approach to combating financial crime, particularly money laundering and terrorist financing. The Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) provides implementation guidance for the financial services industry, while multiple UK bodies share enforcement responsibilities. HMRC serves dual roles as both a supervisory and law enforcement authority. The ML Regulations, POCA, and Terrorism Act form the legislative framework applying to specified UK firms, with additional obligations imposed by the UK financial sanctions regime. The Home Office's Serious and Organised Crime Strategy (2013) implements a four-component framework: PURSUE (prosecution and disruption), PREVENT (preventing engagement), PROTECT (increasing protection), and PREPARE (reducing impact). The 2016 Action Plan for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist finance emphasizes stronger partnership with the private sector, including enhanced information sharing between law enforcement agencies, supervisors, and private sector entities. This collaborative approach aims to target resources at the highest risks and prevent individuals from becoming involved in money laundering activities."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,17,Law Enforcement; Financial Regulation; Compliance; Risk Assessment; Senior Management Responsibilities,"The content outlines key initiatives and regulatory frameworks for combating money laundering and terrorist financing in the UK. It describes three main areas of focus: enhancing law enforcement capabilities, improving supervisory effectiveness, and expanding international cooperation. The text references the UK's national risk assessments (NRA) of money laundering and terrorist financing, published jointly by HM Treasury and the Home Office in 2015, 2017, and 2020. The document emphasizes senior management's responsibilities in managing business operations and complying with ML Regulations, POCA, and the Terrorism Act. For FCA-regulated firms, specific responsibilities are detailed in FSMA and the FCA Handbook. The FCA provides guidance through their Financial Crime Guide, which helps firms counter financial crime risks. The content stresses the importance of moving beyond 'tick-box compliance' toward a more risk-based approach in identifying and preventing criminal activity. The text also references various regulatory frameworks including SYSC and mentions the FCA's role in clarifying expectations through thematic reviews and additional guidance."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,18,Financial Regulation Compliance; Corporate Liability; Money Laundering Prevention; Staff Training Requirements; Criminal Liability,"This content outlines key regulatory requirements and obligations regarding financial crime prevention, particularly focusing on money laundering and terrorist financing. It emphasizes that while firms can separate different financial crime prevention functions, there must be close coordination between responsible parties. The ML Regulations mandate firms to establish adequate policies and controls, with non-compliance potentially resulting in imprisonment and/or fines. Organizations must appoint a board member or senior manager to oversee ML Regulations compliance when appropriate for their size and nature. The text also details criminal liability aspects, explaining that individual officers, partners, or managers can be held personally liable for offenses if they consented to or failed to prevent violations. There's specific mention of criminal liability under POCA and the Terrorism Act affecting staff members. Importantly, firms are required to ensure their employees and agents receive regular training on recognizing and handling potential money laundering or terrorist financing activities, with reference to detailed guidance in Chapter 7. The regulations emphasize both organizational and individual responsibility in maintaining compliance with financial crime prevention measures."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,19,Financial Regulation; Senior Management Responsibilities; Anti-Money Laundering; FCA Compliance; Corporate Governance,"This content outlines key regulatory requirements and obligations for FCA-regulated firms regarding financial crime prevention and management responsibilities. Under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR), deposit takers, insurers, and investment banks must maintain a Management Responsibilities Map that allocates prescribed responsibilities to individual SMF Managers. One specific prescribed responsibility relates to policies and procedures for countering financial crime risk, which must be assigned to an SMF Manager (not necessarily the MLRO).

The text explains the distinction between 'common platform' firms (subject to both MiFID and Capital Requirements Directive) and non-common platform firms, with different but related systems and controls requirements under SYSC 6.1.1 and SYSC 3.2.6 respectively. The FCA emphasizes financial crime prevention as integral to its functions, requiring firms and their senior management to implement appropriate measures for prevention, detection, and monitoring of financial crime.

Specific requirements include the appointment of a director or senior manager responsible for anti-money laundering systems and controls, except for general insurance firms and mortgage intermediaries. Additionally, firms must designate an individual (MLRO) responsible for overseeing compliance with FCA's anti-money laundering rules. The content emphasizes the importance of senior management's operational responsibility in maintaining appropriate systems and controls to combat financial crime."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,20,MLRO Responsibilities; Financial Compliance; Senior Management Duties; Regulatory Requirements; AML/CTF Controls,"This content details the requirements and responsibilities related to Money Laundering Reporting Officers (MLROs) and senior management in financial firms. Key points include:

The FCA requires MLROs to have sufficient seniority within their firms to be effective, either as part of senior management or reporting directly to senior management. Senior management must appoint a qualified MLRO and oversee the firm's AML/CTF strategy.

While overall AML/CTF responsibility should ideally be allocated to a single individual, larger firms may divide these responsibilities among multiple people, provided the division is clearly defined. The relationship between the MLRO and the senior manager responsible for AML/CTF systems must be clearly documented.

Firms must submit annual reports on their AML systems: The MLRO should provide at least one annual report on the effectiveness of the firm's anti-money laundering controls, though more frequent reporting may occur as needed. Senior management must address any identified deficiencies promptly.

Most firms (except credit unions and certain smaller firms with revenues under £5 million) must submit an Annual Financial Crime Report to the FCA. FCA-regulated firms must provide adequate resources to their MLROs, and all firms must allocate sufficient resources to counter money laundering risks."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,21,Financial Crime Prevention; Regulatory Compliance; Money Laundering Reporting; Industry Exemptions; Supervisory Requirements,"The content discusses various aspects of financial crime prevention and regulatory compliance requirements for different types of financial institutions. It emphasizes the importance of the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) role and the need for adequate resources based on a firm's size and complexity. Key points include:

- The effectiveness of anti-money laundering measures depends heavily on the MLRO's competence and internal reporting processes
- General insurance firms and mortgage intermediaries, while regulated by the FCA, are not subject to ML Regulations but must still maintain appropriate risk management systems
- These firms are subject to POCA (Proceeds of Crime Act) and Terrorism Act provisions and may optionally appoint a nominated officer for administrative convenience
- E-money issuers and payment institutions are regulated under specific regulations (Electronic Money Regulations and Payment Services Regulations) rather than FSMA
- The FCA provides separate guidance for e-money issuers and payment institutions regarding their AML/CTF controls

The text also emphasizes the importance of firms being aware of FCA enforcement findings and actions, which are available on the FCA website."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,22,Financial Crime Prevention; Risk Management; Regulatory Compliance; Corporate Policy; Senior Management Responsibilities,"This content focuses on the requirements and responsibilities of senior management in FCA-regulated firms regarding financial crime prevention. Key points include:

Senior management must establish formal policies and conduct risk assessments for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. These assessments should consider UK national risk assessment findings and must be documented, kept current, and available for FCA review. The FCA may waive documentation requirements if sector risks are well understood.

Firms must produce appropriate documentation of their risk management policies and risk profiles related to money laundering, though there are some exceptions for general insurance firms, mortgage intermediaries, e-money issuers, and payment institutions.

A formal AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing) policy statement is required to:
- Provide clear framework and direction for the firm and staff
- Identify responsible individuals and functions
- Outline how senior management assesses and manages risks
- Be tailored to the firm's specific circumstances (generic documents are discouraged)

The policy should include guiding principles that clearly state the firm's culture and values regarding financial crime prevention. This documentation serves as both a practical framework and a demonstration of senior management's commitment to preventing financial crime."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,23,AML/CTF Compliance; Risk Management; Customer Due Diligence; Corporate Governance; International Banking Regulations,"The content outlines key components of financial institutions' anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) policies and procedures. It emphasizes several critical commitments, including customer identity verification, ongoing customer monitoring, staff training on legal obligations, and internal suspicious activity reporting. The text details a risk mitigation approach that involves allocating responsibilities, implementing risk-based monitoring controls, and establishing appropriate supervision of policy execution. The document stresses the importance of wide communication of these policies throughout the organization to ensure effective implementation. Regarding international operations, UK financial institutions must implement a group-wide AML/CTF strategy for overseas branches, subsidiaries, and outsourced operations. Parent companies are specifically required to ensure their policies and procedures apply consistently across all subsidiary undertakings and non-UK branches, including establishing group-wide protocols for data protection and information sharing about customers, accounts, and transactions. While maintaining group-wide standards, the text notes that reporting processes must still adhere to local laws and procedures in different jurisdictions."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,24,AML/CTF Compliance; International Regulations; Subsidiary Management; Cross-border Operations; Regulatory Reporting,"This section outlines key regulations regarding anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) requirements for firms operating across international borders. According to Regulation 20(3),(4), when a firm establishes subsidiaries or branches in third countries with less stringent AML/CTF requirements than the UK, they must ensure these entities apply equivalent measures to UK standards. If local laws prevent such compliance, firms must notify the FCA and implement additional risk management measures. Regulation 19(6) mandates that firms must communicate their AML/CTF policies, controls, and procedures to all overseas branches and subsidiaries. The text also addresses suspicious activity reporting requirements, noting that reports may need to be filed both in the local jurisdiction where the suspicion arose and with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). Finally, the section warns about extra-territorial implications, emphasizing that firms with international connections (through listings, activities, branches, subsidiaries, or correspondent relationships) may be subject to multiple jurisdictions' AML/CTF and financial sanctions regimes. Senior management is advised to seek guidance on how these overseas regulations might affect their firm's activities."
JMLSG-Guidance-Part-I_July-2022.pdf,25,Internal Controls; Regulatory Compliance; Money Laundering Prevention; Risk Management; Corporate Policies,"This chapter focuses on internal controls required for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. Under Regulations 19-24 and SYSC Chapters 2, 3, and 6, firms must establish and maintain comprehensive policies and procedures that are proportionate to their size and business nature. Key requirements include: 1) Establishing and maintaining adequate policies to prevent money laundering operations, 2) Implementing controls that account for business-specific risks, 3) Maintaining oversight of outsourced activities, and 4) Regular review of these controls. The policies must be approved by senior management and documented in writing. Specific requirements cover internal controls, employee screening, internal audit functions, risk management practices, customer due diligence, record keeping, suspicious activity reporting, and staff training. FCA-regulated firms have similar obligations under SYSC. The guidance emphasizes that controls must be both adequate and appropriate, focusing on effectively mitigating identified risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Firms must also monitor and manage the effectiveness of these policies and ensure proper internal communication of procedures."
